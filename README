NAME
    Device::MegaSquirt - Perl5 module for communicating with a MegaSquirt
    controller

SYNOPSIS
     $dev = '/dev/ttyUSB0';
     $ms = Device::MegaSquirt->new($dev);

     $tbl = $ms->read_advanceTable1();
     $tbl = $ms->write_advanceTable1();

     $tbl = $ms->read_veTable1();
     $tbl = $ms->write_veTable1();

     $val = $ms->read_crankingRPM();
     $res = $ms->write_crankingRPM($val);

     $data = $ms->read_BurstMode();

     $version = $ms->get_version();

DESCRIPTION
    Device::MegaSquirt provides operations for communicating with a
    MegaSquirt controller [http://www.msextra.com]. Operations such as
    reading/writing tables, reading live data, and writing configuration
    variables.

    This part of the module (Device::MegaSquirt) is a template and version
    specific modules (Device::MegaSquirt::*) implement the interface.

OPERATIONS
  Device::MegaSquirt->new($dev);
      Returns object (TRUE) on success, FALSE on error

      $ms = Device::MegaSquirt->new($dev);

    The device ($dev) is the file name of the serial device on which the
    Megasquirt controller is connected (e.g.: /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyS0).

    "new" will attempt to open the device and determine the version and
    signature of the controller. It will return a version specific object on
    success.

  $ms->get_version()
      Returns: version number on success, FALSE on error

      $version = $ms->get_version();

  
    Remaining operations are implemented in the version specific module.
